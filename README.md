# Intro to Programming â€” COP3363

This repository contains my assignments and projects from **COP3363 (Introduction to Programming in C++)** at Florida State University.  
The goal is to showcase my work in learning programming fundamentals, problem-solving, and C++ development.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

| Folder       | Description                                                                                         |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `assign_01`  | Simulates ordering from the Krusty Krab. Asks user for item quantities, calculates total with tax. Assumes correct input. |
| `assign_02`  | Calculates area and perimeter of geometric shapes based on user input.                              |
| `assign_03`  | Coin counting game where user enters a dollar amount and quantity of coins; user wins if total matches amount. Option to replay. |
| `assign_04`  | Menu-driven program with multiple mini-games and win/loss tracking.                                |
| `assign_05`  | Creates an array of size `SIZE` (constant between 5 and 20). Values change between runs for testing array size flexibility. |
| `assign_06`  | Prompts user for a sentence and a single word, then prints statistics about the sentence and repeats if desired.                  |
